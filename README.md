## Hashlinks - Cryptographic Hyperlinks

When using a hyperlink to fetch a resource from the Internet, it is often useful
to know if the resource has changed since the data was published. Cryptographic
hashes, such as SHA-256, are often used to determine if published data has
changed in unexpected ways. Due to the nature of most hyperlinks, the
cryptographic hash is often published separately from the link itself.

This specification describes a data model and serialization formats for
expressing cryptographically protected hyperlinks. The mechanisms described
in the document enables a system to publish a hyperlink in a way that
empowers a consuming application to determine if the resource associated with
the hyperlink has changed in unexpected ways.

While mechanisms such as [RFC6920](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920),
[Resource Integrity Proofs](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/resource-integrity-proofs.md)
and
[Magnet Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) exist, they
have a number of shortcomings such as implementation complexity, a focus on
narrow use cases, and no clear extensibility or upgrade path.

This specification attempts to preserve the good parts of
[RFC6920](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920), standardize the good parts of
[Magnet Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) and
[Resource Integrity Proofs](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/resource-integrity-proofs.md)
while ensuring that implementation complexity is kept to a minimum.
